# SDCI

This is the official implementation of our preprint paper "Bidirectional Cross-Perception for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing Imagery" (
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2601.21159). 

We proposed a novel training-free OVSS method, termed SDCI. SDCI introduces the bidirectional interactions between CLIP and DINO, and constructs a convex-optiminzation-based collaborative prediction strategy which employs superpixels as strutural constraints and integrates both interacted outputs of CLIP and DINO.
